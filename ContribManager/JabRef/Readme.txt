This package allows to launch the "JabRef" program from within
WinEdt.

---------------------------
 INSTALLATION
---------------------------

Open the macro file "Install.edt" in WinEdt, and execute it by
choosing "Macros" menu > "Execute Current Macro".

---------------------------
 UNINSTALLATION
---------------------------

Open the macro file "Uninstall.edt" in WinEdt (also available in
%b\Uninstall\JabRef folder), and execute it by choosing "Macros"
menu > "Execute Current Macro".

---------------------------
 USAGE
---------------------------

You can launch JabRef through the command "JabRef" in the
Accessories menu or the corresponding toolbar button or the
shortcut Ctrl+J.

If the current file in WinEdt is a bib file, JabRef will open that
file, otherwise an empty instance of JabRef will be started.

If you are using the jar version of JabRef, at the first usage of
the package you will have to select the correct jar executable.
