\begin{abstract}
  In recent years, statistics and data analysis are gaining new interest in all human activities. In addition to traditional use in official statistics and economy, it is getting very popular in life and social sciences and modern businesses. Modern societies are producing enormous amounts of data and we are facing so called Big Data and open data revolution. Computer technology, used for calculation, visualisation and communication, advance rapidly. All this influences the skills that are needed for a future expert in statistics and data analysis. I will touch some questions and directions of what we have to give to our students that will be useful in their work and help them to be cooperative and competitive with other professions that are growing the interest for statistics.
